# Player Performance Development Analysis (Excel)
Excel dashboard highlighting short-term player performance trends using rolling 5-match averages for goals and assists.

## Project Overview
This project presents an Excel-based performance analysis dashboard designed to track and interpret the attacking development of football players over time. Instead of relying on isolated match statistics, the dashboard uses rolling averages to highlight short-term performance trends.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of match-level performance records for multiple players across a series of matches. Key per 90 metrics such as goals and assists are included, along with match dates and player identifiers. Rolling 5-match averages are applied to smooth short-term fluctuations and support trend-based analysis.

## Key Features
- Dynamic player selection using Excel data validation  
- Rolling 5-match averages for goals per 90 and assists per 90  
- Interactive line chart that updates automatically with player selection  
- Clean dashboard layout focused on trend interpretation  
- Sheet protection to prevent accidental changes  

## Analytical Purpose
The dashboard is designed to support player performance monitoring by visualising scoring consistency and creative involvement over time. It enables users to assess recent form and short-term development rather than overreacting to individual match outcomes.

## How to Use
1. Open the Excel file.
2. Select a player from the dropdown menu.
3. Observe the updated trend chart showing attacking performance over time.
4. Refer to the insight box for guidance on interpreting the trends.

## Tools Used
